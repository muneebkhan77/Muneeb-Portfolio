# Loan data analysis
* The aim was to create a credit risk model to calculate the probability of default for all personal accounts in the bank.
* I was assigned to take in raw dataset and prepare it for the models.
* I was provided with information about every feature and a set of instructions on how to clean and preprocess the data.Numpy was used to preprocess the raw dataset.
* All categorical variables were quantified and when measuring credit worthiness I was risk averse and distrustful i.e in case of a missing value I assumed the worst

# Recruitersspace
* The aim was to establish a recruitment system where the applicants can submit their profile details electronically which can be accessed by the recruiters through a dedicated portal to ease the process of recruitment.
* Initially, the applicant is requested to fill a form to create applicant’s profile. Upon successful submission of the form, all the details that the applicant enters is stored into the data base. On the other hand, the recruiter can access all the applicant profiles stored in the database. The recruiter can also filter or sort all the application suitable to the recruiter’s needs.
* In python, Flask and Django are the two web development frameworks available. We have opted for Flask because it involves minimal coding, is lightweight and is easy to deploy in production. Moreover, to display data on html page, stored in database related to a particular applicant, we have used jinja templates, available only in Flask.
